### Measuring the madness: how tough was it?
Every race tells a story â€” not just of who won, but how hard it was to win. In this section, we dive into the details that define the character of each race.
Use the toggle to switch between **total distance** and **average speed** to explore how these iconic races have evolved.
Were they longer in the past? Has the pace picked up over the decades?
We even highlight the top 3 fastest or longest editions, along with periods like the World Wars that left their mark on the sport.


```js
const selectedMetric = Mutable("Distance");
const switcherElement = createSwitcher(

);

const metricMap = {
  "Distance": { value: "distance", label: "Distance (km)", color: "black", unit: "km" },
